# 2D Game Engine
In this repo, I try to develope a simple (based on C++ programming language and SDL library) 2D game engine.

## Setup
Windows users can use WSL.
``` bash
# Install SDL2 library
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
sudo apt install libsdl2-image-dev
sudo apt install lua5.3

# Compiling the project on your computer
make

# Running the application
make run
```

# Soloution for Possible Errors
